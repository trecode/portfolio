        <h3>Bespoke Design</h3>
        <p>
          Bespoke design is based on deep learning and understanding a
          specific user and their needs. It includes reserch, analysis,
          ideation and prototyping.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this project, I conducted research using various research
          methods such as interviews, observation, photographic research,
          experiment, and questionnaires.

        <h4>Low-fi prototype</h4>
        <img src="img/low-fi.jpg" />
        <p>
          Creating a low-fi prototype helped me to build up the structure of the story. I was making corrections pretty
          often but it didn’t take much time thanks to the very basic visual representation. The biggest value that I
          noticed in making the low-fi prototype is that the mistakes and experiments don’t cost much time.</p>
        <p>
          The interesting finding is that the process of creating even low-fi prototypes causes new ideas and boosts
          creativity because I was completely immersed in the work, processing the visual data, and as a result getting
          new ideas.</p>

      <div class="high-fi">
        <h4>High-fi prototype</h4>
        <img src="img/high-fi.jpg" />
        <p>
          During the work on the high-fi prototype I tried to focus on stimulation and adding aesthetics. It helped me
          to create more empathy for the main character because now he has a face and expresses emotions.

        </p>
        <p>
          I also tried to use the animation here and there to make the experience more amusing. I think that the low-fi
          prototype was a good way to build the structure whereas the high-fi prototype helps to make an engaging
          experience.
