            <h2>HELLO! HELLO!</h2>
            <p>
              I am Elvira - a UXD student at THUAS. I like to plan and optimize the processes in my life, from cleaning
              the apartment to working on complex design projects. I appreciate proactivity and self-sufficiency in
              people, so I always try to match these qualities. <br>

            <p>After I began to actively study UX design, I see it in everything: in objects, services, and of course in
              the digital space. Now I canâ€™t help to look at things through the prism of design thinking, asking myself
              what stands behind the ideas and implementations? </p>

            <p>I find every stage of design very exciting, but most of all I like to transform user knowledge into
              ideas,
              and ideas into real products. As a student, I consider myself more like a junior professional and approach
              university projects seriously and responsibly.</p>

            <p>I believe that design has the power to transform our minds and behavior, and as a designer, I am aware of
              my responsibility to improve the world in which we live.</p>

            <p>At the moment I'm looking for an internship for the period from September 2022 to February 2023. I would
              love
              to work in a company that shares my values and is ready to welcome the proactive and hardworking UX junior
              specialist. If you feel that I would be a good fit to your company please contact me.</p>
