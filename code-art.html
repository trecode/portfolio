        <h3>Code Art</h3>
        <p>
          Code Art is a combination of technical knowledge and creativity which is used to produce digital art.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started learning art coding in the Bootcamp organized by my university. All the works are represented in
          this section are the result of 5 days of learning and practicing the Processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Processing is a versatile integrated development environment and a programming language which is used to code
          the visual art.

        <p>
          I wanted to incorporate music in my creative codding, so I decided to make an equalizer with different
          appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all I found out how to upload music and how to combine it with the picture. For the music I used
          sound library and to make the image react to the music I used volume value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I created the first dynamic image using the strokes and round functions. I played with the random
          positions of the element and I got something looking like a nest.
        </p>

        </video>
        <p>
          All equalizers I have created have nice gradient combinations and depending of the volume of the music the
          gradient combinations are changing. I used arrays to define colors, and later it simplifies my work with
          colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have 4 different equalizers, and I created unique functions for all of them.
          Using conditionals, I assigned different equalizers to “O”, “P” and “L” keys. So, when one of them is pressed
          the equalizer is changed.

        <p>
          I created a circle of tringles using the round functions and for loop. I gave it a nice gradient color using
          lerpColor function, and I created my own function to reuse the code with colors if needed

          The interaction happens when you move the mouse on the screen and when it reaches the center of the screen
          the image is changing to another shape with a different color. I use if and else conditions to make it
          possible.</p>

        <h4>Dynamic poster</h4>
        <video playsinline autoplay muted loop>

        <p>
          You see a dynamic poster that changes after each run.
          For this project, I was using basic functions in processing like ellipse, stroke, background, and line.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rainbow is made of 7 ellipses, each smaller than the previous one on 100px. The ellipses have no fill
          but
          have strokes with 50px weight.
          To make the sun change its location after each run, I used the "random" function. I applied random() for x
          and
          y positions for the ellipse.
        <p>
          I also used the "random" function to make the background change its color. I did the same to the rainbow
          colors, so each color changes its shade.
          The raindrops are also changing their shade of blue.
        </p>

        </video>
        <p>
          To create a digital version of the magic ball I coded a circle with a smaller circle inside – that is the
          ball. Then I created 6 possible answers (yes, no, sure, maybe, yep, nope) and placed them exactly in the
          center of the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          I assigned a number to each answer and used “random” function for these numbers when mouse is clicked. So
          when you click the mouse the code gives random numbers from 0 to 5 and you see one of the corresponding
          answers.</p>
